A simple client for interacting with Bungie's Destiny API.

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/waltfy/destiny?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The intent is to implement [more and more end-points](https://gist.github.com/waltfy/3f707a1ea7454997e484) as time allows.

Please feel free submit issues and requests.

## Usage

```js
Destiny
  .search({ type: 1, name: 'waltercarvalho' })
  .end(function (err, res) {
    // do stuff
  });
```

## Getting Started

### Proxy Server

Unfortunately you cannot hit `https://bungie.net` directly. So if you plan to use this library in client-side code, due to `CORS` you'll have to run your own proxy server to handle your requests to Bungie for you. I have added an example proxy server ([`proxy.js`](https://github.com/waltfy/destiny/blob/develop/proxy.js)). Simply run `node proxy.js`. Credit to [@phuu](https://github.com/phuu).

### Node

`npm install destiny-client`

Note that if you wish, you may override the default host (`https://bungie.net/`) with your own. i.e. If you have a proxy server to handle your requests. See [proxy-server](#proxy-server) instructions above.

```js
var Destiny = require('destiny-client')(/* { host: 'http://localhost:9000' } */);
```

### Web

Simply include [`desiny.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waltfy/destiny/develop/destiny.js) or [`destiny.min.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waltfy/destiny/develop/destiny.min.js) on your page. You will most likely need a proxy server due to `CORS`. See [proxy-server](#proxy-server) instructions above.

```html
<script src='destiny.min.js' type='text/javascript'></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var client = Destiny(/* { host: 'http://localhost:9000' } */);
  client
    .search({ type: 2, name: 'yourusername' })
    .end(function (err, res) { /* do stuff */ });
</script>
```

## API Overview

In all requests `type` is a `Number` representing the account type, or what network you are in. The network types are:
* `1`: XBox Live.
* `2`: PlayStation Network (PSN).

**NOTE:** In order to get the definitions from Bungie (more detail, and more data) pass in `{ definitions: true }` in the optional parameter `query`.

### Search Player

* **`Destiny.search({ type: Number, name: String[, query: Object] })`**
  * `type`: Network type.
  * `name`: Your Bungie name.
  * `query`: An object used to create a query string.

### Account

* **`Destiny.account({ type: Number, id: String[, query: Object] })`**
  * `type`: Network type.

  * `query`: An object used to create a query string.

### Character (Inventory, Activities, Progression)
